      </p>

      <h2>2. Who we are and how to contact us</h2>
      <p>
        Home Reels is operated by the developer of the app. For support, contact
        <a href="mailto:support@homereels.co.uk">support@homereels.co.uk</a>.

        <li>You are responsible for keeping your login details secure.</li>
        <li>You must provide an email address that you control.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Your content and data</h2>
      <p>
        You are responsible for the data you add to the Service, including the movies and series you save and the ratings you submit.
        We store your email address, a hashed password, your saved title IDs, and your ratings so the Service can function and sync.
        For details, see the <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Acceptable use</h2>
      <p>You agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Service in a way that is unlawful, fraudulent, or harmful.</li>
        <li>Attempt to access or interfere with other users’ accounts or data.</li>
        <li>Reverse engineer the Service except where permitted by law.</li>
        <li>Scrape or abuse third party data sources accessed via the Service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Subscriptions and purchases (if offered)</h2>
      <p>
        If the Service offers paid subscriptions or in app purchases, they are processed by Apple via the App Store.
        Pricing, billing, renewals, and cancellations are handled by Apple and are subject to Apple’s terms.
        Any free trial, where offered, will convert to a paid subscription unless cancelled before the trial ends.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Service availability and changes</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to keep the Service available, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted access.
        We may change, suspend, or discontinue the Service (in whole or in part) at any time.
        Where reasonably practicable, we will try to give notice, for example through the app or via your account email.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Backups and data loss</h2>
      <p>
        While we take reasonable steps to protect and store your data, you acknowledge that data loss can occur.
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any loss of your collection, watch list, ratings, or other data,
        whether due to technical issues, accidental deletion, security incidents, service outages, or discontinuation of the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Disclaimers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis.</li>
        <li>We do not guarantee that the Service will meet your requirements, be error free, or be free from bugs.</li>
        <li>Movie and series metadata may be provided by third parties (such as TMDB) and may be incomplete or inaccurate.</li>
        <li>This product uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>10. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        Nothing in these terms limits liability where it would be unlawful to do so, including liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud, or fraudulent misrepresentation.
        Subject to that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any indirect, consequential, special, or incidental loss, including loss of profits, loss of data, or loss of goodwill.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where liability cannot be excluded, our total liability arising out of or relating to the Service will be limited to the amounts you paid to use the Service in the 12 months before the event giving rise to the claim, or if you have not paid anything, £0.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access if you breach these terms, or if we need to protect the Service or other users.
        If the Service is discontinued, your access and stored data may be removed. See section 8 on data loss.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>
        The Service, including its design, code, and branding, is owned by us or our licensors.
        You are granted a personal, non exclusive, non transferable licence to use the app for your own personal use.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Your use of the Service is also governed by our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Changes to these terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these terms from time to time. We will post the latest version on this page and update the effective date above.
        By continuing to use the Service after changes take effect, you agree to the updated terms.
      </p>

      <h2>15. Governing law</h2>
      <p>
        These terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales, and the courts of England and Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction, unless mandatory local law says otherwise.
