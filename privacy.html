      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p class="note"><strong>Quick note:</strong> This template is provided for convenience and does not constitute legal advice. You should review it for your specific setup (for example your hosting provider, email provider, analytics, crash reporting).</p>

      <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 24 January 2026</p>

      <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        Home Reels is a movie and series companion app that lets you save titles, maintain a watch list, add ratings, and view insights.
        If you have questions about this policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@homereels.co.uk">support@homereels.co.uk</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>What we collect</h2>
      <p>We collect the minimum information needed to provide the service:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Email address</strong> (personal data) to create and manage your account.</li>
        <li><strong>Password</strong> which is stored as a <strong>hashed password</strong> (we do not store your plain text password).</li>
        <li><strong>Saved title identifiers</strong> for movies and series (for example TMDB IDs) to store your collection and watch list.</li>
        <li><strong>Your ratings</strong> for movies and series.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal data.</p>

      <h2>How we use your information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To create your account and authenticate you.</li>
        <li>To store and sync your collection, watch list, and ratings across devices.</li>
        <li>To generate insights based on your saved titles and ratings.</li>
        <li>To communicate with you about service updates or support requests (only when needed).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Legal bases (UK GDPR and EU GDPR)</h2>
      <p>We process your personal data based on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contract</strong>, to provide the app features you request (account, storage, sync, insights).</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong>, such as preventing fraud and maintaining security.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent</strong>, where required (for example, if you opt in to marketing emails in future).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sharing and third parties</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal data. We may share data with service providers that help us operate the app, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hosting and database providers</strong> that store your account data and saved title IDs.</li>
        <li><strong>Email delivery providers</strong> (if we send account or support emails).</li>
        <li><strong>Security and monitoring providers</strong> to protect the service and detect abuse (if enabled).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These providers act as processors and are required to protect your data and use it only to provide services to us.</p>

      <h2>TMDB</h2>
      <p>
        The app may fetch public movie and series metadata (such as titles, images, cast) from third party sources like TMDB.
        Your account data (email, saved title IDs, ratings) is stored by us. Public metadata is retrieved as needed to display content.
      </p>

      <h2>International transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Your data may be processed in countries outside the UK or EEA if our service providers operate globally.
        Where this happens, we use appropriate safeguards such as contractual protections.
      </p>

      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We keep your account data for as long as you maintain an account.
        If you delete your account (or request deletion), we will delete or anonymise your personal data within a reasonable period,
        unless we must retain certain information for legal or security reasons.
      </p>

      <h2>Your rights</h2>
      <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access the personal data we hold about you.</li>
        <li>Correct inaccurate data.</li>
        <li>Delete your data.</li>
        <li>Object to or restrict certain processing.</li>
        <li>Receive a copy of your data (data portability).</li>
        <li>Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To exercise these rights, contact <a href="mailto:support@homereels.co.uk">support@homereels.co.uk</a>.</p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organisational measures to protect your data.
        No method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>
        Home Reels is not intended for children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us and we will take appropriate steps.
      </p>
